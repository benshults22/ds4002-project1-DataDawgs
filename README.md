### Reproducing Results
1. In GitHub, open the SCRIPTS folder. Download `Project_1_Code.ipynb` and upload it into Google Colab.
2. In GitHub, open the DATA folder. Download `Restaurant reviews.csv`.
3. In your Colab notebook, upload `Restaurant reviews.csv` by clicking Files on the left sidebar and dragging the file into the session root (not into any subfolder).
4. Run the notebook cells **top-to-bottom**.
5. The notebook will:
   - Drop empty or missing review text rows
   - Drop non-numeric rating rows
   - Convert ratings to sentiment labels:
     - Rating < 3.0 → negative
     - Rating = 3.0 → neutral
     - Rating > 3.0 → positive
   - Clean review text (lowercase + remove punctuation/stopwords)
   - Convert text to numeric features using TF-IDF
   - Split into train/test sets
   - Train **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**
   - Print model evaluation metrics and generate confusion matrices
6. Confirm your results by checking:
   - Printed classification reports + accuracy in the notebook output
   - Confusion matrix figures
